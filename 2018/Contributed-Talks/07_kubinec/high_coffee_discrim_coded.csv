There is no ""burnt sox"" smell to these beans. Its a dark and rich blend with excellent flavor. I have tried several cans of the Kick Ass Dark with no complaints but no real bonding either. The 454 Horse Power Dark is perfect for when a richer, darker, brew with ""wake-up!!"" powers is needed! The beans are nicely dark-roasted & fresh. My 454HP is med coarse ground as needed and done in a french press - yes, I want all the oils & flavors possible! It should provide serious espresso too.

I don't eat any sugar of any kind, and I focus a lot on how anything I consume is going to make me feel. Having said this, I think this product is the best-tasting supplement I have ever had. It reminds me a little of chocolate milk, but with a lot less sugar and garbage in it.<br /><br />I poured it into my water bottle after working out. I did not even shake it much and it mixed right in without being gritty or lumpy. I drank it about 45 minutes ago, and I feel good. I didn't get a ""rush"" of energy, but I feel more of a calm energy that comes from feeling healthy and well-nourished. I am looking for a product to replace the caffeine in the organic coffee I drink. I hope this is it. Time will tell. I also chose this product because of the health benefits of maca. Time will tell on that, too.<br /><br />Another thing I like I about this product is it comes in little individual serving packets. This would be great for camping. It seems to be easily digested and absorbed, which is another major advantage.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this product so far. I bought this company's chai vanilla meal replacement, also. It doesn't have any sugar. Unfortunately the chocolate flavor does have sugar, so I didn't buy that one. I will review that one after I try it. I'm just really thankful for products like this.<br /><br />I bought this product at my local health food store. It was on sale for $22.99. Amazon is again, by far the best place to buy things.

Fiber from apple pectin, organic oat powder, organic flax seed powder. Also L acidophilus, peppermint, Siberian eleuthero root, and sea salt.<br /><br />The flavor is pleasant. It's like the taste of bitterish dark chocolate bars with a grassy undertone that isn't offputting. It's not like it's a chocolate malted or anything, but it works fine for me. I can drink this. I do not gag. Yay.<br /><br />I will reorder this. I like the healthful profile and the flavor.<br /><br />UPDATE: Okay, I didn't really expect a noticeable effect from this (I mean, I've had superfoods before and didn't suddenly go change the world or anything), but I have actually noticed an uptick in my energy after adding this to my pre-workout smoothie and my pre-chore protein drink. I've been adding it to BSN sytha-6 chocolate protein mix with an extra teaspoon (heaping) of Raw cacao (organic), and it's a nice flavor combo. I think it would be great with a banana, too, for extra potassium (a chocobanana vibe).<br /><br />Maybe it's placebo. Who knows? But as I wasn't thinking I'd notice a change, maybe not.

I ordered both the Normal and Kids Samples of the Green Superfood variety. The chocolate was the first one I tasted, and by far, the best. So, it's the one I bought. I have used this stuff for 2 weeks now.<br /><br />Taste: The taste is pretty fair. Not the best. Not the worst. Compared to the other flavors, this stuff is fantastic. It has a very apparent chocolate flavor with hints of a ""green"" flavor. It is not very sweet, but not bitter, either. I use plain, unsweetened almond milk to mix mine with, and it tastes decent. However, it tastes best when blended with half a frozen banana, or just half of a banana with some blended crushed ice. When prepared this way, it's really quite good. Drinking it with a milk of some variety is rather important, as when mixed strictly with water (didn't have milk at one point) it tastes absolutely horrific. Taste wise, this stuff is maybe a solid B. I certainly appreciated it most after trying the Berry, Lemon Lime, Original, Kids Chocolate and Kids Berry flavors. They were all absolutely repulsive. I let a couple of people I work with try the Berry with me, one girl ran to the bathroom gagging, one spit it out, and the guy who tried it choked it down unwillingly and stuffed about 3 peppermints into his mouth afterward, cursing me for having him try it. So, compared to those, chocolate is exceptionally good.<br /><br />Texture: The texture depends on how it's blended. If you just use milk, it does get chunky and doesn't blend well. If you blend it with a small amount of water first, then add your choice of milk afterward, it blends much better and you should get a chocolate milk appearance. I have had several occasions where it just didn't blend, even with water, for some reason. When I blend it with a frozen banana, I do not add milk. The blender seems to be the best way to get it all good and mixed up perfectly.<br /><br />Health Effects: This is why I gave this product a full five stars. It's absolutely amazing. I read so many reviews thinking ""placebo effect"" or ""it certainly won't affect ME that much."" However, I've noticed very distinct differences in my health. My chronic fatigue has  disappeared. I simply don't get sleepy throughout the day anymore. Also, I have food sensitivities to dairy, grains, and excessive sugars, so I typically eat a paleo-ish diet. Normally, when I eat something even remotely bad, such as a cupcake, I'll become extremely exhausted within an hour and will always break out within a day or two. However, I've eaten very poorly the past week with candies, donuts and even a pizza with cheese. I drink this stuff immediately after and the inevitable crash NEVER comes and my face doesn't break out. I actually left this stuff at home over the weekend when I was out of town, and when I had a donut without drinking this stuff after, I had my usual crash followed by a mild breakout. Had some candy this morning, followed by this stuff, and again, no crash. For the health benefits alone, this stuff lives up to the hype and it's name. It truly is amazing."

(I don't think that Starbucks is as good as serious espresso bars, but we don't have any nearby.) So I was excited when Starbucks announced VIA, and I tried both flavors as soon as I could get my hands on them*. I was surprised to find that not only did both of them taste harsh and acidic, but they gave me a stomachache.<br /><br />After confirming several times that I wasn't just imagining the stomachache, I stopped buying VIA. Luckily a relative introduced me to Taster's Choice Colombian instant coffee, and it is not only better-tasting in my opinion but it doesn't bother my stomach. As a bonus, it is about one third the cost of VIA.<br /><br />*Rather than mixing instant coffee with water, I add it to a cup of hot milk and stir in a bit of sugar."

I tried it the traditional route--as a hot cup o' java. I did not like it. Not this roast and not the Columbian (which was so weak, why bother).<br /><br />So, it's hot. It's summer. I normally hit Starbucks after the gym for my fave iced sugar free vanilla latte. I saw the ad for the iced coffee VIA, but it has sugar. I don't want sugar. So, it hit me, why not try making iced coffee from the regular VIA. (duh, should have thought of that sooner). I bought a 3-packer (like this one shown in image).<br /><br />It was amazing. 2% milk (about a cup), ice, Starbucks sugar free vanilla syrup (I buy it at my local Starbucks), in a blender bottle and shake, shake, shake. It comes out frothy and delicious. FOr me, I like it BETTER than my habitual 2 to 3x a week fix of it at the store. Because you add the VIA to the milk and the milk is cold and the instant coffee is not hot (like espresso), there is NO DILUTION. It makes for a much more flavorful, less watery, iced latte. OH MY GOSH SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.<br /><br />Now, my problem is not having three lattes a day, instead of three a week. Seriously. I'm a junkie now. (And I have coffee everyday, but my homebrew is so much better than Starbuck's that I don't get hot coffee there, I just used to like the convenience--still do--of grabbing a fast latte after exercising. I have a great coffee set-up at home with Paradise Roasters and Terroir gourmet single origins and a Technivorm and a Barratza burr grinder and filtered water pitcher, so really, now that I can make a fast latte at home and take it with me to the Pilates studio and put in the fridge there until I'm done, I may not be visiting the Starbucks as much, except to get my fave protein plate now and then and stock up on VIA.)<br /><br />The product is crazy overpriced. What...more than five bucks for what's 3 servings? How sick is that? Buy it at the store unless the price is dropped. That's crazy.<br /><br />But, nummy latte.<br /><br />So, if iced lattes are you vice of choice, might wanna consider this. And if you don't want sugar, skip the one they're pushing now in the blue packaging and buy the unsweetened.<br /><br />And I just slurped one after dinner (latte that is). Addictive. (Er, literally, I guess.) But at least I'm getting my calcium. :D<br /><br />This price is much better than the other one I reviewed on Amazon (by another supplier). But I still think it's overpriced. Once you pour out all those servings, it's just a few teaspoons of instant coffee. Amazon would move tons of this if they priced it more reasonably."

Empty the Via pack, add water, stir, and you will get a strong, bold, and flavorful cup of coffee. You can taste the heaviness of either flavor, Columbia or Italian.

(Hey, I also give 10% of my income to good causes, so I'm not TOTALLY decadent.)<br />I'm sure someone on here can tell me they exist in the midwest, but I didn't find a place for over a week with a decent cup of coffee, and while I know on a scale with world peace that isn't a tragedy, I LOVE coffee.<br />From the freeway as we came into the Denver area, I spotted a Starbuck's sign and begged that we leave the freeway and find it. When I told the barista at Starbuck's about no good coffee for a week, she introduced me to Via packets I could carry in my luggage or even purse.<br />I was totally sceptical that instant coffee would be drinkable, and then completely won over when I tried it. I don't know how Starbuck's managed it, but Via smells good, tastes good, and is incredibly convenient and easy to use. It goes with me everywhere I travel now.<br />On mornings when I don't head for my neighborhood latte stand, I add Via straight to hot milk and get a very (relatively) inexpensive treat. I seem to be doing this more and more, and saving a lot of money doing this. If you thought instant couldn't be good, suggest you try Via.<br /><br />Added: I travel quite a bit -- both nationally and internationally -- and one of the first things to go in my suitcase when I pack are VIA packets.

Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!!

She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its ""food"". and the company who makes it basically said ""Sorry, but it sucks to be you"".

This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands, but I would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good.  We just had to order another case.  Try it with some coffee.  Mash it up in some vanilla ice cream. Seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude's first name.  First name only brands really cheese up the product.  How about ""Cocoa Passions"" or ""Divine Cocoa"" or even, ""Serenity Now Cocoa"".  Anything would Glam up the product name a little.

It was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor.  There were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop.

You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.

Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.

It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate."

I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

My tea background was first drinking Indian milk tea using black loose tea, milk, spices, and sugar. I added far-Eastern teas (non-milk varieties) in my search for a quicker tea to brew (milk tea needs more time to prepare). I am on my 3rd box of PoP Oolong tea. The tea is not like black or green teas. Be prepared for a bitter taste but with a sweeter aftertaste. Like black teas, this produces some kind of coating feeling on the tongue, almost similar to eating an unripened banana. It is somewhat woody in taste and smell (maybe a bit flowery. It may also be slightly sour, but less than some green teas. I have tried whole leaf oolong from a Chinese shop and that was more like green tea. If you can afford more expensive oolong teas, then you might get better quality. For the price, you're getting a good deal. I also think that the batches vary so sometimes you might get a stronger, bitter flavor but if you experiment with the brewing, you might get your desired flavor.<br /><br />To brew this PoP Oolong tea, realize that ground tea in bags will release their flavors much faster. My solution is to boil some filtered water. After bringing to a boil, I turn off the stove and add 1 cup (237 mL) hot water to the tea bag. Then wait ~30 seconds (or golden brown color appears)and remove the bag. The first cup usually extracts most of the caffeine and is the most bitter and strong taste. Now I can brew with another cup of the hot water. I can brew around 4 cups with the colors being golden brown, golden, light green, and very light green. It is best to brew by the color and not the time. If you leave the bag in too long, it will be terribly bitter.<br /><br />Tea brewing is an art and science, as many other things in life are. Please refer to the science of solvent extraction for a better idea. Basically, you are extracting the tea's aromatic compounds into the water. The flavor of the brew are mainly affected by water quality, extraction time (the time in water), and water temperature. You have to experiment with this for your preferred flavor. Sugar is absolutely not necessary, if prepared correctly."

It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their ""100% satisfaction guarantee"". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item ""powdered"".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products."

From corn, not birch","Erythritol tastes like sugar, just like xylitol.  It is not, however, toxic to pets as xylitol is.  Also, it does not have the gastrointestinal effects (bloating, gas, etc.) that can come with intake of large quantities, as is the case with xylitol.  Both are quite safe for people, however.  Dogs cannot eat chocolate, either, due to toxicity, so xylitol is just another thing that works for us but not for them.  But erythritol is safe for both people and animals.<br /><br />The downside to erythritol is that it costs more than xylitol and is only 70% as sweet as sugar, whereas xylitol is closer to being the same sweetness as sugar.<br /><br />I haven't had much luck baking with either of them -- but maybe others have had different experiences.<br /><br />Both xylitol and erythritol taste great - I can't tell them from sugar.  Stevia is also a healthy sugar alternative, but it definitely has a taste -- not pleasant in large amounts (bitter).<br /><br />Not all brands of xylitol and erythritol are equal.  Many come from birch trees which often is extracted using sulfuric acid.  The ones from NOW Foods are from corn, which does not require sulfuric acid.<br /><br />This is a good company and I have been very happy with them.  On the other hand, I did not have a good experience with Emerald Forest's products or customer service.  Their products come from birch trees and have a very unpleasant odor.  I much preferred the products from this company - they taste great and don't really have an odor."

I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong ""cotton candy"" aftertaste.<br /><br />The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the ""cotton candy"" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol."

My immediate reaction upon trying this was that it is very thin and watery. I'm assuming a big reason for that is they use lowfat milk. The Starbucks and Caribou drinks I usually buy are slightly more unhealthy than this drink, but they have a rich, flavorful taste and are slightly more substantive compared to this drink. Since I only drink them on the rare occasion (maybe a couple times a month), the health differences aren't a huge deal for me.<br /><br />This Cappucino does have a nice light flavor to it, with equal hints of cocoa and coffee, but it's not nearly as boldly flavored as the aforementioned drinks. Considering the price is just as expensive as others in the category, I don't think this would be my first choice when on the go and in need of a quick pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't be completely opposed to buying it for a change of pace down the road.<br /><br />If you enjoy a lightly flavored coffee drink that's not too thick, you'd probably love the illy issimo line of drinks.

Because I had consumed an Italian Espresso style drink by the same company at room temperature a few days ago, I decided to chill the cappuccino to see if I liked it any better than the tepid espresso. The only difference I could detect was that the cappuccino was slightly sweeter but still had a bitter, metallic aftertaste not improved by chilling. If I were taking a trip to some isolated place where I could not expect to have coffee every morning, I might take the cappucino along for emergency rations, but otherwise, no.

When compared to Starbucks and Java, the liquid in the glass is still darker than the others.  (See posted photograph.)  I don't think Starbucks has to worry about losing customers to Coca-Cola.  I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy coffee drinks manufactured by Starbucks instead of illy issimo.<br /><br />  Also, I don't quite understand why the cans of illy issimo say, ""Do Not Shake.""

I always shake my bottles and cans of coffee drinks before opening them.  The contents have never spewed like carbonated soda; instead, they have appeared slightly frothy.  However, I just remembered from looking at the ingredients (which I have posted on this website) that both illy issimo Caff&egrave; and illy issimo Cappuccino have potassium bicarbonate.  Perhaps the potassium bicarbonate will cause the coffee to spew if shaken.  Why do these products contain potassium bicarbonate?  Commonly found in club soda, potassium bicarbonate softens the affects of effervescence.  It is also used as a fire suppression agent (""BC dry chemical"") in some dry chemical fire extinguishers.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Cappuccino is recommended for coffee drinkers who love sugar and cream in their coffee but think Starbucks has too much in their products.  Perhaps you are a long-term consumer of Starbucks products and you desire something different; illy issimo Cappuccino would be worth trying for a change.  I wonder if the Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, will be offering free samples of the illy issimo coffee drinks.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos"

It got better with the second sip, and did get better than others of this type that I've tasted before (like Starbucks Frappuccino, etc). There's a real coffee taste, which I appreciated. The milk and/or cream part wasn't overpowering, which did allow the coffee taste to come through. Glad to say that it lacked the sweet dairy flavor of many of the popular drinks in grocery stores, many of which come from artificial sweeteners.  There was a mild aftertaste that remained ten minutes later; not unpleasant, but not great, either.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Must note that I'm one of those who as a rule drinks coffee black, with no sweeteners, cream or creamy substitutes.

Temperature is also a difficult think to master (it always seems too hot or too cold!) However, this coffee blend is a masterful mix of my favorite sweetness, creaminess, and blackness. It's rich, but not too rich. It's sweet, but not too sweet. And no bitter aftertaste! I refrigerated it and thought it tasted great cold.<br /><br />With that being said, I would never spend $2 on a little tiny 8.45oz can of it.

It is only recently I started to find some canned coffee-related goods (i.e. coffee ""drinks"") on the shelves in the mainstream supermarkets. Normally, real canned coffee come from Asian markets.<br /><br />When I saw this being offered on vine, it piqued my curiosity. How would it compare to Asian coffee? I had thought that perhaps an Asian company was trying to make its market in the states through the Internet, but I was wrong.<br /><br />Upon close inspection, I realized that it's made in Denmark but the Coca Cola company. Huh, Coke? Interesting.<br /><br />Amazon shipped the can in a bubbled mailing bag, those yellow kind. Pretty standard. However, the can did come with many dents. I don't know if it was already there before they sent it to me, or perhaps the mailing process caused those. I'm just the can was not broken when it got to me.<br /><br />It says ""do not shake"" on top of the can - very different from all the ""shake well"" notices in the Asian beverages. This leads me to wonder - perhaps it's not made with powdered coffee like most Asian beverages.<br /><br />I also see ""sugar"" in the ingredients instead of some artificial sweetener. To me, that is a plus.<br /><br />I'm used to drinking pretty sweet coffee in a can, and this was not so sweet. Yes, it's sweet, but it's not too bad, compared to the Asian coffee in a can I had grown used to. It is, however, not for anyone who is looking for black coffee. The can does say ""cappuccino."" It's somewhat bitter, a little bit acidic. I know some other reviewers said it's metallic in the taste, but I don't taste that much - perhaps I've been jaded by the Asian canned coffees?<br /><br />Overall, I give it a four stars for the taste. It's not bad at all. I would drink it every day if it weren't bad for me."

I drank the majority of the relatively thin and compact can but they had tiny sips as well. We all loved this beverage. We were already familiar with the wonderful coffees (both whole and ground) made by Illy Issimo. So I was curious to see how this new addition to their line would hold up.<br /><br />If you like a very dark roast flavor, you should know that this cappucino flavor is more on the light side, similar to coffee with some cream and sugar. The sweetness is not overpowering and thankfully  doesn't match the sickening, cloying sweetness of so many canned drinks and sodas. And, after researching the brand, I discovered that this was indeed a goal - to create a refreshing coffee drink without only a touch of sweetness. I think they succeeded admirably.<br /><br />At 100 calories a can, this is an easy treat to fit into a diet plan and isn't just sugar and fizz but has added milk - so as treats go, this is a reasonable option.  Hate added preservatives? You won't find those, either. You will find caffeine, however, so look for the caffeine-free versions if you can't handle the extra buzz and energy. They are readily available.<br /><br />If you're driving for a few hours or across country, these are ideal for taking along because they take up so little space.

The aroma, the flavor...even the process of brewing a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I usually buy organic whole beans and grind my own by hand just before making. I prefer a french press but have probably owned most forms of making coffee ever invented...sometimes the most simple is the best. Why do I mention this?

The only regular coffee I purchase from the store is Bustelo...yes, back to my original coffee roots!<br /><br />In any case, I was curious about this and opted to give it a try. Vine users receive 1 can which I was forced to split between myself and the spouse...we both agreed, it was delicious! No odd aftertaste, no harsh chemical flavoring, not too sweet (a common problem) and the coffee flavor was present but not overpowering.<br /><br />Bottom line...we both liked it! Now, being rather health conscious, I'd prefer an organic option however, this is kosher (a major consideration for us) as well as free from preservatives AND uses the higher quality arabica beans rather than robusta...compared to a soda or even loaded up coffee alternative at a local Starbucks, this is a great option/alternative. Wonderful to take along anywhere especially when you can't stop and prepare a full pot of real coffee during the day."

I like the flavor of illy espresso, but my favorite is still the Nespresso line of coffee <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UW1KLM"">Nespresso Citz D110 Espresso Machine, Silver Chrome</a>.  When I saw that Coca-Cola was distributing illy in-a-can from Denmark, I immediately thought it might be a nice cold drink for my early morning, one-hour commute into the city.<br /><br />This morning I pulled two cans from the frig and drank them as I drove to work.  I tasted both the ""cappuccino"" and the ""caffe"" flavors.  Here are my thoughts:  The coffee in these cans is nothing like what you make at home in your espresso machine--the richness is missing.  illy makes a medium and a dark roast.  The coffee in these cans are more like the medium roast--definitely not dark.  But, bottom line, coffee in a can tastes exactly as you feared it would:  Coffee with that ""special"" canned taste.<br /><br />Comparing the two flavors that I sampled this morning, I like the cappuccino better than the caffe <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  I think the cappuccino works better than the caffe as a cold drink.  The cappuccino went down quickly and easily, but there was an aftertaste that I didn't quite like.  Even after finishing the second coffee (the caffe without milk), I could still taste the lowfat milk and it was not fresh-tasting.  I'm not used to sweetness in my espresso and the sugar in these cans made the coffee taste a bit tangy.  I did not notice any bitterness in either of the flavors.<br /><br />Be aware of the size of these cans:  They are not as large as soda pop cans.  They are narrow cans, with the cappuccino can about an inch taller than the caffe can.  I mention this because I had trouble finding a place to set in my vehicle's console because they are so narrow.  Your vehicle's can-holder space will be too large for these cans.  You  would have to wedge them in somehow to keep them from toppling.<br /><br />So, as with most everything else that you buy for convenience-sake, with these coffee drinks you sacrifice flavor for handiness.  If you really don't have time in the evening to put together a bottle of iced coffee for your morning commute, then the cappuccino is not a bad drink.  If you like a sweet coffee and if you like milk in your coffee, then the cappuccino is not a bad choice.  Personally, even though I don't have any extra time in the evening, I think I'll try to find the time to build myself an iced coffee for the morning--because I've just realized that it is very pleasant to have cold coffee to drink for my long commute, and canned coffee is not to my taste."

I was pleasantly surprised to read that in this 8.45oz can, there are a mere 100 calories and 1.5g of fat.  Yet there are 4g of protein, so it's not just energy but some protein as well.  For those of you on Weight Watchers, it is 3 PointsPlus points.  The product is distributed by cCca-Cola, but is made in Denmark.<br /><br />Upon opening the can and taking a sip, I was surprised by how thin and watery the drink tasted.  It didn't taste bad, but not was not particularly flavorful or good either.  Perhaps this is because it is only lightly sweetened and has low fat, but there was just no body or interesting flavor to the drink.  I think it's just not good coffee.  It just tasted flat and lifeless.  I've sipped cold Starbucks left in my car for a few hours before and quite enjoyed it - this was nothing near that.<br /><br />All of that being said, competing products such as Starbucks bottled Frappucino has almost twice the calories, fat, and significantly more carbs.  Possibly this is why they taste better, but as I said before, I think the coffee they use in this drink is also not high quality.<br /><br />So for a light chilled coffee beverage, it's not a terrible choice, but not a particularly interesting or tasty one either.

I would drink coffee while working and become so inspired by my work that my coffee frequently became cold. But I drank it anyway. It tasted good enough that I soon experimented with commercial cold coffee drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.<br /><br />The popular brand, however, doesn't do much for me so I began to look around for a more enjoyable substitute and decided to try illy issimo cappuccino, an Italian espresso drink made with low fat milk and cocoa. I loved it! This drink has a rich, deep coffee flavor that is not overbearing but lingers until you reach for the next drink. The taste-rich drink, not particularly healthy, is made of natural Arabica coffee.<br /><br />This drink is made by illy cafe, a company started in Trieste, Italy, the Adriatic port town where coffee first entered Europe. The company was started in 1933 by Francesco Illy, the man who developed the modern espresso machine. The ready-to-drink product is distributed globally through an agreement with Coco Cola. The drink is available in 140 different countries.<br /><br />I enjoyed this drink right out of the can but others get more pleasure by pouring into a glass and adding ice. The drink does come in a narrow, smaller 8.45 ounce can which does not excite me but I guess it's done for style reasons. Overall, an enjoyable drink."

Nice surprise!,"I would never have tried this brand through VINE had others not told me it was their new preferred brand of Canned Cappucino and now I see why.  it's 100 Calories and has a nice smooth taste with no bitter, overbrewed or over-roasted flavor you can sometimes get with Chain shop Cappuccinos, Frappuccinos or iced Lattes.  The sugar is a little bit strong at 18 grams for the 8.45 ounce can but overall, that's low in comparison to many competing brands.  It's got a nice strong cofee taste and hint of chocolate which is strong enough to add to some ice and blend if you want to cut your sugar intake and economize by using half a can at a time.<br /><br />Unlike their Canned Espresso, this item does have some thickening agents like Carageenan (a seeweed extract used the way Chia seed glop is used to thicken) and Cellulose Gum which is a plant fiber derived thickening agent.  But most canned Cappuccinos have these and usually higher on the list. It's likely there because they opted for lowfat milk.  The thickeners are liekly to make up for the lack of Milkfat.  Since they're common food addtives and not something I don't ordinarily get in most prepraed foods, I'm not bothered by it.  In fact, itheir ingredient list is quite short compared to some manufacturers' canned of bottled Cappuccino drinks.  At least they don't add oil to it!  As for the Cafeine load - Issimo has 81 Mgs of Caffeine which is still less than 2 Excedrin tablets so that's not a huge amount of caffeine by comparison.<br /><br />I enjoyed this and will likely use it as my new canned Cappucino option.  The price is comperable to my old brand and cheaper than others. As far as the sugar issue goes, I'll likely drink half a can at a time and blend it with ise since that's the way I like my Cappucinos.  I won't be missing the line at Starbucks or all the added calories.  This way, I can choose what I add to my Cappuccino and my waistline!"

Alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />Here's my take on this cappucino drink:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  Convenience -- With these cans at home or at the office, you can heat up a full cup of cappucino in a minute in the microwave. No dragging out the cappucino maker or running out to get a cappucino.<br /><br />2.  Foam -- After heating, you will see a small amount of foam on the top of the coffee.<br /><br />3.  Low-Cal -- Only 100 calories in this cappucino,<br /><br />and therein lies my problem.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1.  Taste -- Even though I love cappucino, I don't have it often.  When I do give in to the urge, I want it rich with two packs of raw sugar, whole milk, and a generous dash of cinnamon on the foam.  Heavenly.  But this cappucino just doesn't measure up to my idea of what cappucino should be.<br /><br />2.  Off Flavor -- There's an odd taste of tin in my cup.  Maybe it's the cinnamon, maybe it's the can -- I can't say, but I can say that the flavor is tinged with an odd tinny taste.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />If you're not picky about cappucino, this could be your drink.  I'll wait and get mine just the way I like it at my local coffee house."

I'm a Starbucks lover and I love the cafe au lait New Orleans style coffee with chickory also.<br /><br />I rate this drink 3 stars = It's Okay because for me, it's too thin due to the lowfat milk and it's flavor is not quite bold enough for my palate.

I like cappuccino beverages and I am a regular consumer of coffee, so this beverage sounded like something suitable to my tastes.<br /><br />This cappuccino drink is a little different from what I expected. Poured from the can into a glass, it looks like chilled hot chocolate with a mocha scent. It also contains a little less volume than I would prefer. The can is only 8.45 fluid ounces in size, so it is consumed completely in a very short time.<br /><br />As for the taste, it isn't as rich as I was expecting. I wanted something a little stronger and fuller bodied- something closer to an espresso. The taste of this drink, while certainly not bad, isn't very strong. It is chocolaty and coffee- like, as expected, with a creamy, medium to light body. It tends toward the sweet side, which is also not my preference. I drink all coffee- related beverages black, so I am not used to tasting sugar with my roasted brew. In addition, the sugar flavor in this beverage is different in taste and part of the reason is because the manufacturer uses beet sugar. This is probably healthier than refined sugar, but it does result in a little different flavor that may not suit the preferences of different drinkers.<br /><br />I like a good cappuccino and this one is really not a bad selection. A few tweaks of the recipe would make it a little better, but I agree that it is very easy drinking and has enough good taste to recommend."

My husband didn't taste the cocoa immediately and had to look at the can for confirmation (I am the chocolate aficionado in the family!).

Of note is that the Cappucino single serving can is a couple ounces greater and double the calories.  My personal preference was the Caffe because I found it to taste fresher, less like a canned beverage, less sweet, and stronger in the coffee flavor.<br /><br />I gave away my Nespresso machine and currently do not have an electric espresso maker other than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5F0"">Delonghi EMK6 Alicia Electric Moka Espresso Coffee Maker</a> and prefer very strong coffee.  I still make it on the stovetop or prepare French drip coffee.  I sometimes use Splenda and froth steamed milk.  I used to roast green coffee beans but have also given away my roasters.  I grind beans prior to preparing coffee.  Just a little history for my frame of reference in writing this review.<br /><br />I'm not at all crazy about this coffee drink because my first impression was the sweetness, followed by the milky and very thin taste, and I experienced an aftertaste that I didn't care for.  I don't use much sugar, so that's perhaps why my taste buds were more sensitive, and as with all four tasters, although the ingredients listed Cocoa, we tasted very little in this beverage.  The coffee flavor was stronger than a simple cup of coffee, but the other flavors overwhelmed the coffee for me personally.  All three other tasters liked this flavor and said they would buy it if it's cost was around a dollar.  Two of the four tasters drink Chai regularly, always with lots of milk and sugar added.<br /><br />Our natural instinct is to shake a non-carbonated beverage, but there are strict instructions stating that the can is not to be shaken.  The can is nice to look at, smaller than a soda can and may cause problems in a beverage holder if you take these on a road trip.  At the current cost and weighing in at about 25 calories per ounce, I'm not going to recommend this product."

I much prefer the Starbucks Mocha Cappuccino drink that tastes only of coffee, milk, sugar and chocolate.  I do not know if it is the metal container that imparts the aftertaste to the Illy product.  The similar Starbucks drink comes in a glass container that I suppose could have something to do with its fresher taste.  Also, since my opinion is certainly subjective, others may like the Illy drink and be just as justified in their opinion."

For the purposes of this review, I will try to compare the two products which are similar and yet also strikingly different.<br /><br />The illy drink is slightly smaller than a bottled Frapp, offering 8.45 ounces as opposed to Starbuck's 9.5 ounces.  Yet nutritionally, within that small difference, I found that illy has 90 fewer calories (100 as opposed to 190) and one gram less saturated fat (1 as opposed to 2) than Starbucks.  These are minimal differences unless, of course, you drink these sorts of beverages regularly.  Drinking illy once per day instead of a Starbucks Frapp would ultimately save you close to 33,000 calories in a full calendar year and, of course, 365 grams of saturated fat.<br /><br />As far as taste, I found that illy emphasized the coffee flavor with a refreshing hint of chocolate.  As far as the bottled Frappuccino goes, I've found that Starbucks is the exact opposite, emphasizing the chocolate taste with more of a hint of coffee.  Ultimately, it's up to personal tastes.  I'm not a regular bottled coffee drinker, but I would be willing to reach more often for illy for the simple fact that it's a little bit healthier and a little less sweet than Starbucks."

On a particularly hot day, I stopped for gas and saw these in the cooler at the gas station, so I purchased one. How refreshing! It is the perfect drink to enjoy on a hot day while driving. It truly hit the spot, and unlike other brands of canned coffee beverages (including Starbuck's), this one has an authentic coffee flavor with the perfect balance of milk and sweetener. This is the second canned coffee I have tried by illy, and there seems to be a real emphasis on quality versus quantity.<br /><br />And when it comes to coffee, I'll take quality any day."

To me it tastes more like a cold mocha than a cappucino.  Taste is relative (and surely based in part on what we're accustomed to drinking); I like it (and normally Peet's Italian Roast is my drink of choice).  But thanks to the calorie count, for me at least, it's a sometime treat and not a morning ritual.<br /><br />For those who choose to drink it regularly, the fact that it's preservative free and the lowfat milk is rBST-free should be a bonus.  Although this does mean that the cans are labeled with expiration dates.

Isserman ""Kisserman""",1,2,4,1339200000,Illy Issimo Coffee Drinks,"I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.<br /><br />First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.<br /><br />Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.<br /><br />All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be."

To succeed, you either need to be creative enough to stand out or of such a high quality, you can gain traction.  Illycaff&egrave;, the Italian coffee company that created this product, is actually decades older than Starbucks.  However, they're relatively new (since 2009) to producing the single-serving canned beverages known as ""Illy Issimo.""  One thing that's for sure, if you're going to compete with a giant like Starbucks, it helps to have a giant of a partner.  Illycaff&egrave; has Coca-Cola, so we can call it a fair fight.  There are five different flavours of the Illy Issimo canned coffees: Caffe, Sugar-Free Caffe, Cappuccino, Mochaccino, and Latte Macchiato.<br /><br />The first flavour I decided to try was the classic Cappuccino.  Here's a breakdown of the elements:<br /><br />Smell: Dull, unappetizing, with only hints of a Cappuccino aroma.<br /><br />Taste: Quite the same as the smell.  It's not a vibrant Cappuccino taste and, though brewed with Arabica, the coffee flavour is just not strong enough.  The aftertaste, also, isn't very good.  It really can't compete with the Starbucks canned & bottle releases.<br /><br />Nutrition: 100 calories and 18g of sugar is not that bad for a full coffee drink like this.  However, if you again compare it to the Starbucks Frappuccinos, it's not a big enough difference to warrant the nutrition difference.  The Frappuccinos contain only 50 more calories and 8g of sugar, but keep in mind the Starbucks bottle contains quite a bit more than these cans.<br /><br />Overall, while this Illy Issimo Cappuccino drink is convenient, the taste just isn't nearly good enough to compete with the at-home Starbucks releases.<br /><br />-AP3-"

The more I drank, it seemed too sweet and too bitter at once, which is a strange and not altogether pleasant combination. As it is essentially comparable to drinking an iced espresso, it may not be as palatable as some of their other creations. But, it's not really something that I would sample again. And at an approximate cost of $2.00 per can (only 6.8 ounce), this serves more as a caffeine boost than a refreshing beverage. Made with real Arabica coffee, I was also intrigued by the ""Do Not Shake"" warning which left me with the unappetizing visual of the particulate matter that must still be in the liquid drink (fine for Turkish coffee, not so appealing for something in a can).<br /><br />Cappucino (3 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Espresso Style Coffee Drink with Lowfat Milk and Cocoa. So, at 8.45 ounces this is a slightly bigger drink. As some of the harshness is buffered by the milk and cocoa combination, this one easily had a more pleasant taste. Still, a bit sweet for my liking but better overall. I'm still not blown away and I won't be a regular purchaser of this, or any illi issimo brand drinks, but I didn't dislike this one.

I am guessing this is from the potassium citrate.  I'm not sure what the purpose of this ingredient is, and again I would be curious how it would taste without it.

I like this much more than the syrup sweet thick Starbucks variety.<br /><br />Illy is a maker of excellent espresso coffee and machines. They are all over Europe, where the red square with Illy on it is visible, the espresso will be good - never great or spectacular, but never bad; always the same, always very good. It makes sense that they would produce a very nice clean not too sweet iced cappuccino drink in a can.<br /><br />The comparison to Starbucks Frappuccinos is just too easy to make. Starbucks packs 180 calories and a lot more sugar in their drink. They are good and tailored to the sweet tooth, more like a sweet soda pop than an espresso beverage. Illy's drink is about half as sweet and feels a lot thinner in the mouth. These are all good things. There's a good strong flavor of an espresso. The milk flavor is slightly burnt or caramel, a good flavor that reminds me of steamed milk.<br /><br />Illy does something a little bit different from Starbucks. Where Starbucks builds their mouth feel with sugar, Illy has chosen to use a bit of gum in the mix (carageenan, cellulose, and cellulose gel). It's a very simple food science issue, milk and coffee alone will end up feeling like water from the can. In order to make the drink taste rich, they have to add some body to it - Starbucks chose sugar and Illy chose gum. I'd take the gum over the additional sugar any day of the week.<br /><br />I really like this drink a lot more than Starbucks. I love the clean espresso and milk flavor without the sweetness.

This taste like a two day old cup of coffee that's been left in the microwave. No kidding! When the weather starts getting hot I don't drink that much coffee so I only need to make a fresh pot every other day or so. My morning routine, like most people, usually starts with looking for a cup of coffee. If there's any in the pot left over from yesterday I'll nuke a cup. depending on how much is left in the pot I might make a fresh one. Well, this tastes a lot like two day old coffee that's been warmed up in the micro wave, forgot about, and found the next morning. Blah Yuky pucky too-ey! Oh, just FYI, when I make a fresh pot of coffee, after its finished dripping I turn the burner off so it doesn't sit there and cook for two hours. Then when I want a cup I warm it up in the microwave and it tastes pretty close to fresh. Its at least better this way then letting it sit there cooking for two hours first and it saves on coffee. These days it cost too much to throw away half a pot when I don't have to.<br /><br />Since I've never had one of these before I wasn't too sure what to expect but I kinda thought it would have a more creamy feel and taste to it and a little sweeter. It mostly taste like a two day old cup of cold coffee. Actually a two day old cup of MY coffee taste's a lot better. A lot of others seem to like this but I'll pass on it."

After drinking this, I can honestly say that I'm underwhelmed.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this isn't bad but it isn't great either. It's pretty much your run of the mill canned expresso beverage and while I've had worse, there wasn't that much to make it stand out. As others have said, the cocoa flavor just isn't there. That wouldn't actually be something I'd speak out against, except that the drink does claim that it's in there and there will be people who will be expecting to actually taste cocoa. It's not here, or if it is then it's so faint that you wouldn't be able to taste it unless you're really, really looking for it.<br /><br />Now the good thing about this is that it isn't overly sweet. I do like sweet coffee/expresso beverages, but a lot of times the bottled or canned beverages will be just overly saturated with it. This drink isn't, which was actually a nice change of pace and something that I know some of you will appreciate. Another thing that some might like is that it's only 100 calories for the full can, which was nice. It's still 19 carbs, but it's good to have a low calorie option for those of us that are trying to avoid the coffee drinks that have a bajillion calories.<br /><br />Overall, this just didn't stand out that much to me. It's good enough that I'd probably buy it if I was at the store, wanted a cold coffee/expresso drink, but didn't want anything sweet. I just don't know if I'd go out of my way to buy it and stock it up for those times when I really crave stuff like this."

If you expect ANY canned/bottled coffee drink to taste like a fresh iced coffee from a local coffee house (that has actual frothed cream in it and was sugared to your own personal preference), you are going to be disappointed.  I am comparing it to other coffee drinks that also use lowfat milk in them.<br /><br />I'm drinking this wonderful little beverage, as I type the review.  As is consistent with the illy issimo coffee drinks, it's refreshingly restrained on the sugar.  Just enough to compliment the coffee, without trying to turn it into a confection.  This has just enough of the lowfat mik in it to give a slight ""creamy"" taste, without overpowering the flavor of the coffee, as well.<br /><br />There is a perfect blending of the cocoa, cream and sugar to combine with (and compliment) the coffee flavor.  It's not quite as robust as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA"">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. But then again, if you desired that you wouldn't be drinking a cappuccino.<br /><br />I think the illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave; is probably better for a quick wake up call on a rough Monday morning, and this is better suited for around 3 o'clock to help get you to through the rest of the work day.<br /><br />Serve chilled, and whatever you do, don't shake it.

But I was pleasantly surprised with this Cappucino illy issimo Coffee Drink. It's excellent over ice.  Right out of the can, at room temperature, not so much.  But I think these types of drinks are meant to be served very cold.  (Or maybe heated?  I didn't think to try warming it, but I think hot would probably work too.)  What I liked was that it had a very 'clean' taste, no funny aftertaste like some canned drinks have.  In fact, there was no aftertaste at all.  There was just the right balance of coffee, sugar, milk and a little bit of cocoa powder so it wasn't too sweet.  I didn't notice the cocoa powder taste when I drank it.  I think it just adds to the overall flavor.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients:  Coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, celluose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan.  The caffeine content is 81 mg per the 8.45 ounce can.  Compare that to 48 mg. per 16.9 ounces of caffeine in Coke Zero.

(I love Japan and China where there are so many different ones some served hot some cold, all from vending machines and convenience stores, but the US is sadly much more limited).<br /><br />Rockstar Vanilla Roasted remains my number one choice for canned or bottled coffee.  That said, I enjoyed this and would choose it over pretty much anything made by Starbucks and DEFINITELY over anything made by Archer Farms (or whatever that Target brand is) or Monster (ew, ew, ew) that's in my local grocery or gas station.<br /><br />I like it because 1) it actually tastes like coffee instead of some weird flavored creme thing and 2) it isn't horribly sweet - maybe a tad more than I prefer but I like my sweetness really low in cold coffee so that's a personal preference.  The aftertaste is good...pleasant not strong and not going sour an hour later.  The coffee kick is also there so it's a good pick me up.<br /><br />However, it's still not perfect.  A few complaints: 1) It's got a bitter metallic taste that hits every time you first get some in your mouth.  It's not a normal coffee or espresso flavor - it fades quick and isn't horrible, but it's weird and not my favorite, 2) the can is a little flimsy.  The edges rolled over on the top of mine even though it shipped in a padded envelop.  I don't know that it would puncture any easier though - most cans are thin at around the cylinder.  3) biggest complaint - the mouth is too small.  You couldn't glug it if you want to, but it's also kind of awkward.  Basically forces sipping and makes it so it's hard not to completely cover it with your mouth if you're used to other cans which creates a bad situation for flow (for a liquid to flow into your mouth easily, air has to flow into the can easily to replace it.)<br /><br />Anyway, 4 stars.  If I don't have access to my own french pressed coffee from home, don't feel like paying for specialty coffee, and can't find the Rockstars on shelf, I could see reaching for this as the next choice when I really want some coffee flavored caffeine."

The Starbucks mocha Frapachinos (bottled) are usually the only coffee-esque drink that I like, and even those I only drink a few times a year. The illy issimo Cappuccino wasn't bad - it wasn't nearly as creamy as the Starbucks drinks, but it was also around a half of the calories, so there's a bit of give and take there. It's also not super sweet - many of the Starbucks drinks border on that thin line between really tasty and ""The sugar is melting my teeth"". The illy issimo is very safely stashed on the not-super-sweet side of the fence. Don't take that to mean there isn't any sweetness - I'd compare it to a Symphony chocolate bar versus a Hershey's milk chocolate bar. They both have very similar flavor profiles, but the generic Hershey bar is so much sweeter. I can't really say it's like a dark chocolate either, because the cappuccino didn't have a lot of the bitter undertones that the dark chocolates and espresso drinks tend to have.<br /><br />As for energy burst, I should preface by saying that I'm not much of a caffeine drinker any more. My normal drink is straight water, and at restaurants iced tea (unsweet). I think my body has stored up reserves of caffeine and sugar from my childhood days though - back when I drank a six-pack (or more) of Coke a day. That being said, the ""rush"" from the drink took a few hours for me to feel it (granted I had already eaten lunch and had a full stomach, which might explain the lag). But when it hit, it was a sort of ""giddy"" high, not like a super pixie-stick rush.

You are trading taste for convenience.  What I would add to that review is the following:  taste tests have proven time and time again (especially with beer) that beverages consumed out of a can often give the drinker a flavor of ""tininess"" ... however, since modern cans are lined with a plastic coating, this cannot be true ... the tinny flavor is actually in their head, or from the top of the can's exterior.  Further, when taste testers are served the same beer (Budweiser, Stella, Guinness, etc.) in two glasses (one poured from a can, and one poured from a bottle) they overwhelming choose the beer poured from the can.  This is because bottles leak sunlight and oxygen - two things that ruin beer.  Cans don't leak oxygen or sunlight, so a fresher, better tasting beer will always come from the can - so long as you don't drink it directly from the can.  The same is true with this product.  If you drink if from the can, you will always enjoy it less than a fresh cappuccino.

It is an 8.45 ounce, 100 calorie can of coffee-like goodness.<br />Yes, it actually does contain coffee.  Pretty good coffee, actually.  Illy is not new to the coffee world and some of their beans produce delicious coffee.  Its not surprising they decided to branch out to the portable market.  In doing so, they have joined forces with Coca Cola, likely because of their ability to mass market as well as produce an inexpensive canned product.<br />A cappuccino to an Italian is generally one third espresso, one third steamed milk, and one third foam.  Obviously the steamed milk and foam would be impossible in a chilled can.  But this is meant to be the chilled version of that drink.  Yet it contains cocoa.  Indiscernible cocoa, but it is right there on the label.  I find it a bit confusing, since there are actually 5 different illy flavors.

I would have expected the mochaccino to have a chocolate flavor, and cappuccino to be strong espresso with milk.<br />So, upon opening the can, I expected a (Starbucks) canned frappuccino-like drink.  Despite the warnings stamped all around the top to not shake the can, I could not stop myself.  No explosion, so not sure what that warning is all about.  The coffee drink inside is a rich brown color, tempered with low fat milk.  Has a certain appeal, although I think it might feel more decadent poured over ice.  And while illy knows its coffee, they did not use enough of it in this prepared drink.  Strong espresso can stand up to the addition of milk, and this was not strong enough.  Had a watered down taste to it, much like home brewed coffee with added milk and sugar.  One thing I dislike about frappuccinos is the texture and somewhat artificial thickness.  illy wins hands down here, because the texture has not been altered.  It definitely feels real.<br />Keeping it under 100 calories is a plus, especially if one plans to drink these regularly.  Large fatty fattening coffees with sugar and cream should be reserved for special treats and given dessert status in our lives.  But you could get away with a 100 calorie drink much more often without sacrificing your health.<br />Overall, the Cappuccino Coffee drink is a pretty average addition to the ready to drink coffee market.

Speaking for myself I'd prefer a stronger flavor but the lightness of this will probably appeal to plenty of people.  The can says not to shake but I did not get any hint of carbonation or anything.

I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product.

I had tried Soy milk before but it was like drinking chalk mixed with water. What 'turned me' was Trader Joe's Original Soy milk which is just a perfect milk substitute; but they only sold it in 1/2 quart containers and the store was miles out of my way. Anyway, long story short I picked up a can of this stuff.<br />It's teriffic! Very easy to mix...can even do it with a spoon in a glass of water. Has a great taste and best of all it's a powder so it keeps pretty much forever. I'm trying to live more healthily and this stuff makes the pefect base for my morning smoothie, tastes exactly the same as when I made it using milk, even works ouit cheaper (and higher in protein...well, a bit)."

I suspect the price??? In any case, my kids always looked forward to the Empress Chocolate Cake that I'd make for their birthdays. The recipe was printed on the can at that time. So when one of them mentioned that they'd *sure* *love* to have one of those cakes again (code for ""pleeeeeeeeeease mommy!"" that they can't say anymore because they're a bit older) I found the recipe online and came straight here to see it I could get the powder here.

This product is a fine white powder, with clearly visible sugar crystals, that mixes very easily with the espresso and frothed milk for our white chocolate mochas. Product has a good flavor when mixed according to directions: not too sweet. Be aware, this is a flavored powder, probably not white chocolate at all, because it contains no cocoa butter, which I believe is used to make white chocolate. White chocolate isn't chocolate at all. The first three ingredients of this product are sugar, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, and corn syrup solids. You decide whether the price for this is a good value, or whether this is really a white chocolate product or, as the label states, ""SWEET GROUND WHITE CHOCOLATE"" followed by the very important word, in smaller print, ""FLAVOR."" We will continue to search for the perfect white chocolate flavoring for our mochas, but we are pleased with this one."

I was disappointed by this product. It's not terrible, and does taste moderately decent, but really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I've had plenty of white chocolate mochas in my life, and this product just didn't deliver. We usually use organic brown sugar to sweeten our coffees, and in all honesty that tastes WAY better. And is a lot cheaper!<br />The powder is a strange mix of ingredients - none of them real white chocolate. I don't like the fact that it contains Partially Hydrogenated Oils, and, I don't even like using it because it feels like someone just shot a dustcan of vanilla up your nose every time you use it no matter how careful you are. Or like you've snorted vanilla talcum powder. The only thing I can compare it with, is the odd way that microwave popcorn flavoring used to get ya right in the nose, before they removed the diacetyl. ... It feels invasive and chemically induced LOL.<br />Also, when you taste the coffee you make with this product, you're more smelling than tasting. Try holding your nose. Yeah I know scent is a huge part of taste, but this product seems strangely reliant on its phony vanilla scent, and there's really no flavor without it. It also tastes and smells completely unnatural - fake chemical white chocolatey taste/smell instead of real white chocolatey taste/smell. I expected much more from a brand like Ghiradelli, and for the price.<br />It's not great for the waistline either, by adding a whopping 21 grams of carbohydrate to your cup of joe, and 2.5 grams of SATURATED fat per serving. My organic sugar adds between 4-8 grams of carbs, depending on whether I double the serving!<br />Overall, it's fun to try, but not when you have to buy this much of it at one time, and is now a 7/8 full tub of disappointment sitting on our countertop. It's best moment: We experimented and tried it on buttered popcorn. That was kind of good, made a sort of kettle corn taste, aside from the vanilla powder nasal invasion.<br /><br />I'm listing the ingredients here, because I really feel that calling this ""ground white chocolate powder"" is so misleading it's unfair to the consumer, and I don't see the ingredients shown in the listing.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Corn Syrup Solids, Sodium Caseinate, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Dipotassium Phosphate, Propylene Glycol Esthers of Fatty Acids (not kidding), Mono- and Di-Glycerides, Sodium Silico Aluminate (Mmmm), Salt, Soy Lecithin, Calcium Carageenan, and Artificial Color.<br /><br />Just a tip, consider trying organic brown sugar in your lattes and cappuchinos instead. Not the ""sugar in the raw"" brand, but a real organic brown. We find it adds a nice (natural) caramel-ly taste, kind of a cross between a Starbucks white chocolate mocha and caramel macchiato - very tasty."
